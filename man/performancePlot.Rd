}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A list of \code{\link{ClassifyResult}} objects.}

\item{performanceName}{Default: "Balanced Error". The name of the
performance measure to make comparisons of. This is one of the names printed
in the Performance Measures field when a \code{\link{ClassifyResult}} object is
printed, or if none are stored, the performance metric will be calculated.}

\item{characteristicsList}{A named list of characteristics. Each element's
name must be one of \code{"x"}, \code{"row"}, \code{"column"},
\code{fillColour}, or \code{fillLine}. The value of each element must be a
characteristic name, as stored in the \code{"characteristic"} column of the
results' characteristics table. Only \code{"x"} is mandatory.}

\item{aggregate}{A character vector of the levels of
\code{characteristicsList['x']} to aggregate to a single number by taking
the mean. This is particularly meaningful when the cross-validation is
leave-k-out, when k is small.}

\item{coloursList}{A named list of plot aspects and colours for the aspects.
No elements are mandatory. If specified, each list element's name must be
either \code{"fillColours"} or \code{"lineColours"}. If a characteristic is
associated to fill or line by \code{characteristicsList} but this list is
empty, a palette of colours will be automaticaly chosen.}

\item{orderingList}{An optional named list. Any of the variables specified
to \code{characteristicsList} can be the name of an element of this list and
the value of the element is the order in which the factors should be
presented in, in case alphabetical sorting is undesirable.}

\item{densityStyle}{Default: "violin". Either \code{"violin"} for violin plot or
\code{"box"} for box plot.}

\item{yLimits}{The minimum and maximum value of the performance metric to
plot.}

\item{fontSizes}{A vector of len gth 4. The first number is the size of the
title.  The second number is the size of the axes titles. The third number
is the size of the axes values. The fourth number is the font size of the
titles of grouped plots, if any are produced. In other words, when
\code{rowVariable} or \code{columnVariable} are not \code{NULL}.}

\item{title}{An overall title for the plot.}

\item{margin}{The margin to have around the plot.}

\item{rotate90}{Logical. IF \code{TRUE}, the plot is horizontal.}

\item{showLegend}{If \code{TRUE}, a legend is plotted next to the plot. If
FALSE, it is hidden.}

\item{plot}{Logical. IF \code{TRUE}, a plot is produced on the current
graphics device.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ggplot} and a plot on the current graphics
device, if \code{plot} is \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Draws a graphical summary of a particular performance measure for a list of
classifications
}
\details{
If there are multiple values for a performance measure in a single result
object, it is plotted as a violin plot, unless \code{aggregate} is
\code{TRUE}, in which case the all predictions in a single result object are
considered simultaneously, so that only one performance number is
calculated, and a barchart is plotted.
