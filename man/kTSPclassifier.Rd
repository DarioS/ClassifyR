\title{Classification Using k Pairs of Features With Relative Differences Between
Classes}
\usage{
kTSPclassifier(measurements, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{measurements}{Either a \code{\link{matrix}}, \code{\link{DataFrame}}
or \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}} containing the training data.  For a
\code{matrix}, the rows are features, and the columns are samples.}

\item{...}{Unused variables by the methods for a \code{matrix} or a
\code{MultiAssayExperiment} passed to the \code{DataFrame} method which does
the classification.}

\item{classes}{Either a vector of class labels of class \code{\link{factor}}
of the same length as the number of samples in \code{measurements} or if the
measurements are of class \code{DataFrame} a character vector of length 1
containing the column name in \code{measurement} is also permitted. Not used
if \code{measurements} is a \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object.}

\item{test}{An object of the same class as \code{measurements} with no
samples in common with \code{measurements} and the same number of features
as it.}

\item{featurePairs}{An object of class as \code{\link{Pairs}} containing the
pairs of features to determine whether the inequality of the first feature
being less than the second feature holds, indiciating evidence for the
second level of the \code{classes} factor.}

\item{difference}{Default: \code{"unweighted"}. Either \code{"unweighted"}
or \code{"weighted"}.  In weighted mode, the difference in densities is
summed over all features.  If unweighted mode, each feature's vote is worth
the same.}

\item{minDifference}{Default: 0. The minimum difference in densities for a
feature to be allowed to vote. Can be a vector of cutoffs. If no features
for a particular sample have a difference large enough, the class predicted
is simply the largest class.}

\item{target}{If \code{measurements} is a \code{MultiAssayExperiment}, the
name of the data table to be used. \code{"clinical"} is also a valid value
and specifies that integer variables from the clinical data table will be
used.}

\item{returnType}{Default: \code{"both"}. Either \code{"class"},
\code{"score"} or \code{"both"}.  Sets the return value from the prediction
to either a vector of class labels, score for a sample belonging to the
second class, as determined by the factor levels, or both labels and scores
in a \code{data.frame}.}

\item{verbose}{Default: 3. A number between 0 and 3 for the amount of
progress messages to give.  This function only prints progress messages if
the value is 3.}
}
\value{
A vector or data frame of class prediction information, as long as
the number of samples in the test data.
}
\description{
Each pair of features votes for a class based on whether the value of one
feature is less than the other feature.
}
\details{
If the voting is tied, the the class with the most samples in the training
set is voted for.

Because this method compares different features, they need to have
comparable measurements. For example, RNA-seq counts would be unsuitable
since these depend on the length of a feature, whereas F.P.K.M. values would
be suitable.

The \code{featurePairs} to use is recommended to be determined in
conjunction with \code{pairsDifferencesRanking}.

  rownames(measurements) <- LETTERS[1:10]
  colnames(measurements) <- names(classes) <- paste("Patient", 1:10)
  
  trainIndex <- c(1:4, 6:9)
  trainMatrix <- measurements[, trainIndex]
  testMatrix <- measurements[, c(5, 10)]
  
  featurePairs <- Pairs('A', 'C') # Could be ranked by pairsDifferencesRanking function and
                                  # selected internally by tuning of features selected.
  kTSPclassifier(trainMatrix, classes[trainIndex], testMatrix, featurePairs)
