\title{A function to generate a ModellingParams object}
\usage{
generateModellingParams(
  assayIDs,
  measurements,
  nFeatures,
  selectionMethod,
  selectionOptimisation,
  classifier,
  multiViewMethod = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{assayIDs}{A vector of data set identifiers as long at the number of data sets.}

\item{measurements}{Either a \code{\link{DataFrame}}, \code{\link{data.frame}}, \code{\link{matrix}}, \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}} 
or a list of these objects containing the training data.  For a
\code{matrix} and \code{data.frame}, the rows are samples and the columns are features. For a \code{data.frame} or \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}} assay
the rows are features and the columns are samples, as is typical in Bioconductor.}

\item{nFeatures}{The number of features to be used for classification. If this is a single number, the same number of features will be used for all comparisons
or assays. If a numeric vector these will be optimised over using \code{selectionOptimisation}. If a named vector with the same names of multiple assays, 
a different number of features will be used for each assay. If a named list of vectors, the respective number of features will be optimised over. 
Set to NULL or "all" if all features should be used.}

\item{selectionMethod}{A character vector of feature selection methods to compare. If a named character vector with names corresponding to different assays, 
and performing multiview classification, the respective classification methods will be used on each assay.}

\item{selectionOptimisation}{A character of "Resubstitution", "Nested CV" or "none" specifying the approach used to optimise nFeatures.}

\item{classifier}{A character vector of classification methods to compare. If a named character vector with names corresponding to different assays, 
and performing multiview classification, the respective classification methods will be used on each assay.}

\item{multiViewMethod}{A character vector specifying the multiview method or data integration approach to use.}
