#' Transform a Table of Feature Abundances into a Table of Feature Set
#' Abundances.
#' 
#' Represents a feature set by the mean or median feature measurement of a
#' feature set for all features belonging to a feature set.
#' 
#' This feature transformation method is unusual because the mean or median
#' feature of a feature set for one sample may be different to another sample,
#' whereas most other feature transformation methods do not result in different
#' features being compared between samples during classification.
#' 
#' @aliases featureSetSummary featureSetSummary,matrix-method
#' featureSetSummary,DataFrame-method
#' featureSetSummary,MultiAssayExperiment-method
#' @param measurements Either a \code{\link{matrix}}, \code{\link{DataFrame}}
#' or \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}} containing the training data. For a
#' \code{matrix}, the rows are samples, and the columns are features.
#' If of type \code{\link{DataFrame}} or \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}}, the data set is subset
#' to only those features of type \code{numeric}.
#' @param target If the input is a \code{\link{MultiAssayExperiment}}, this
#' specifies which data set will be transformed. Can either be an integer index or a
#' character string specifying the name of the table. Must have length 1.
#' @param location Default: The median. The type of location to summarise a set
#' of features belonging to a feature set by.
#' @param featureSets An object of type \code{\link{FeatureSetCollection}}
#' which defines the feature sets.
#' @param minimumOverlapPercent The minimum percentage of overlapping features
#' between the data set and a feature set defined in \code{featureSets} for
#' that feature set to not be discarded from the anaylsis.
#' @param verbose Default: 3. A number between 0 and 3 for the amount of
#' progress messages to give.  This function only prints progress messages if
#' the value is 3.
#' @return The same class of variable as the input variable \code{measurements}
#' is, with the individual features summarised to feature sets. The number of
#' samples remains unchanged, so only one dimension of \code{measurements} is
#' altered.
