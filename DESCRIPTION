Description: The software formalises a framework for classification in
        R. There are four stages. Data transformation, feature
        selection, and prediction. The requirements of variable types
        and names are fixed, but specialised variables for functions
        can also be provided. The classification framework is wrapped
        in a driver loop, that reproducibly does a couple of
        cross-validation schemes. Functions for differential
        expression, differential variability, and differential
        distribution are included. Additional functions may be
        developed by the user, if they have better performing methods.
