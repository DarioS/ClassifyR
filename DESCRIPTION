Description: The software formalises a framework for classification in R.
             There are four stages. Data transformation, feature selection,
             and prediction. The requirements of variable types and names are
             fixed, but specialised variables for functions can also be provided.
             The classification framework is wrapped in a driver loop, that
             reproducibly does a couple of cross-validation schemes.
             Functions for differential expression, differential variability,
             and differential distribution are included. Additional functions
             may be developed by the user, if they have better performing methods.
